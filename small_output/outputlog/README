This folder contains log files generated from GFDL-FV3 simulations at all resolutions used in the paper.

*_spinup.log are for 8-day initialization.
*_std.log are actual plume transport tests.

These logs record the time series of plume maximum/minimum mixing ratios,
as well as the simulation time and CPU count ("PEs").

timing_summary.ipynb extracts the timing info and print as a table.
