FV3 technical note (for tracer transport tests)

===================================================
1. Pure software engineering part 
===================================================

 -------------------------------
  1.1 Source code
 -------------------------------
$wget ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/projects/Cubed_Sphere/cubed_sphere_public_release.tar.gz

Or visit https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/cubed-sphere-quickstart/

 -------------------------------
  1.2 System environment (reside in FV3code/bin/)
 -------------------------------
Because GCHP contains FV3, we can use the same environment

See build_script/ for sample bashrc on Odyssey and Pleiades

 -------------------------------
  1.3 compilation script (reside in FV3code/exp/)
 -------------------------------
The original fms_runscript includes both compiling the running the model. We only keep the compilation part.

See build_script/ for compile scripts for Odyssey and Pleiades, notice their minimal difference.

===================================================
2. Model configuration (reside in FV3code/exp/ and will be copied to rundir)
===================================================

See model_config/ for basic configurations. We modified the original configuration as follows:

 -------------------------------
  2.1 namelists or input.nml
 -------------------------------
# The basic vertical resolution. By changing npz while keeping npz_rst the same, the restart file will be vertically-regridded online
npz      = 20,
npz_rst  = 20,

# Those operators are the strictly-motononic. kord_tr  = 7 is more accurate although has a little chance of creating overshoots.
# Otherwise, the default options will be (h,k)=(12,8) as shown by logfile.000000.out, which give huge overshoots.
hord_tr  = -8,
kord_tr  = 4,

# Uniform spacing in pressure. Only a few values of npz support non-uniform spacing. 
uniform_vert_spacing = .true.

# Dry-dycore only. No additional forcing. Otherwise we will have crazy temperature.
do_Held_Suarez = .false.
adiabatic = .true.

# Print maximum and minimum values of physical fields.
print_freq = -1,

# Gnomonic-true-equidistant
grid_type = 0

# Use cold start for the first run and warm start for the continued run
warm_start = .false.

# Not sure if this has any effect but the original "Conformal" is incorrect.
grid_name = 'Gnomonic' /

# 13 is the baroclinic instability test that gives us cyclone.
test_case = 13

 -------------------------------
  2.2 field_table
 -------------------------------

We can add arbitrary numbers of passive tracers with any names, for example:
"TRACER", "atmos_mod", "plume01"/
"TRACER", "atmos_mod", "plume02"/

 -------------------------------
  2.3 diag_table
 -------------------------------

We can output the tracers added in field_table by adding new entries:

#outputfiles
"tracer_daily",  24,  "hours",  1, "days", "time",

# All available diagnostic fields
"dynamics", "plume01",    "plume01",   "tracer_daily",  "all", .false.,  "none", 2,
"dynamics", "plume02",    "plume02",   "tracer_daily",  "all", .false.,  "none", 2,

Removing default entries might contaminate the restart file for the continued run. Not sure why.
Had better just add entries and not remove old ones.

===================================================
3. Running and Post-processing
===================================================

 -------------------------------
  3.1 Changing the number of cores 
 -------------------------------

The minimum number of cores is 6. To use 24=6x2x2 cores, set input.nml:
layout   = 2,2
io_layout = 2,2 

 -------------------------------
  3.2 combine outputs into 6 tiles 
 -------------------------------

Each CPU will only write its own domain. Need to combine small files together if #CPUs > 6 

Run ./combine.sh (copied from build_script/ to rundir)

 -------------------------------
  3.3 data analysis 
 -------------------------------

See data_analysis/ for notebooks

For tracer transport we would like to avoid regridding as much as possible, so we would not use fregrid_parallel as in the default fms_runscript

===================================================
4. Additional notes 
===================================================

- Warnings (implicit configurations that could lead to confusion)

1) model still runs with uniform_vert_spacing = .false. and npz = undocumented number,
but that's effectively the same as uniform_vert_spacing = .true.

2) model still uses warm start even if warm_start = .false., as long as input files exist in INPUT/
